Saying "a CP on Tuesday" is ok if you don't remember their name.

: The slides on BFS, otherwise, this was built in isolation

================================ Remarks ====================================

Filling in anything here is OPTIONAL.

Approximately how long did you spend on this assignment?

6 hours (?)

Were there any specific problems you encountered? This is especially useful to
know if you turned it in incomplete.

Testing gets complicated with a program like this, particularly one thats built on another PA

Do you have any other remarks?

Please teach us how to unit test, and how to use valgrind and gdb to
the full extent of their capacity: using cout for debugging feels casual, and
more importantly it is time inefficient. 
However, I really enjoyed this Assignment, so thank you for that! Cheers
