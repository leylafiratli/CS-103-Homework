While 10,000 trials, does sometimes yield highly accurate results, it is not
precise enough to yield consistent results, that is, the values it provides
vary too much to be reliable.

However, the increase from 100,000 trials to 1,000,000 trials yields only about
an increase in .005 in accuracy, meaning that its fairly negligible particularly
considering the increase in computational intensity. 100,000 trials also turns out
to be precise enough to be deemed reliable for most purposes.
