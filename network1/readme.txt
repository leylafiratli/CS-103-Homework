================================ Remarks ====================================

Filling in anything here is OPTIONAL.

Approximately how long did you spend on this assignment?

:5-6 hours

Were there any specific problems you encountered? This is especially useful to
know if you turned it in incomplete.

: Nothing too particular, just that my original imagined implementation didn't mesh with the way
your method prototypes were designed.

Do you have any other remarks?

: Nothing overmuch, just that it may be helpful to provide a bit more freedom in how the implementation details get handled. (For example, it would be really convenient to have encapsulated the User print method within the User class itself, but alas)
